        </div>

        <p align="justify" style="font-weight: bold">Q1. Why the name Pratham? </p>
        <p align="justify">Ans: <b>Pratham</b> means <i>first</i> in Sanskrit. Since, Pratham is IIT-B's first* student satellite, we found the name appropiate.</p>

        <p align="justify" style="font-weight: bold">Q2. What is the role of the faculty of IITB in Pratham?</p>
        <p align="justify">Ans: Since its a Student Satellite, the IITB faculty lead by Prof K. Sudhakar have given the students a free hand in running the project. Hence it is upto the student team to set deadlines, review work and keep the project on track. The faculty are also the PI for the project, and have helped us a lot in managing the monetary resources. </p>

        <p align="justify" style="font-weight: bold">Q3. What is the toughest job for the Project Manager of Pratham? </p>
        <p align="justify">Ans: The First Project Manager of Saptarshi, feels that the toughest job is running the team. We are a team of highly passionate students who want to excel in our work, but tend to drift off in our own orbit sometimes. Hence keeping the team together is the toughest job for a Student Team's leader, he says.</p>

        <p align="justify" style="font-weight: bold">Q4.   I want to setup a ground station in my institute, how do I go about it? </p>
        <p align="justify">Ans: See the section on &quot;Ground Station Workshop&quot;. It discusses the steps and know-how we have provided in helping students from other universities in setting up their ground stations. Then contact Jhonny Jha for further details. </p>

          <h2 class="text-primary">Other Relevant Questions</h2>
        </div>

        <p align="justify" style="font-weight: bold">Q1. Why is Pratham taking so much time to finish? </p>
        <p align="justify">Ans: One of the things we have stressed in the making of Pratham is making it by ourselves. Hence we have not bought any of the Sub-Systems of the shelf, unlike other student satellites. This is not because we dont have the money, but we want to learn and hence dont want to do it. Secondly, we donot have pre-exisiting facility for satellite making. Hence we are anticipating our needs at each design stage and are setting up our lab simultaneously with building the satellite. It is but natural therefore that we will take more time. </p>

        <p align="justify" style="font-weight: bold">Q2. What is the budget of Pratham? </p>
        <p align="justify">Ans: Pratham costs about Rs 1.5 crores, including launch. We have recieved lot of help in this regard both from IIT Bombay and ISRO. </p>

        <p align="justify" style="font-weight: bold">Q3. Why such a large weightage to Flight Model? </p>
        <p align="justify">Ans: Since our main objective is learning, we want to give it enough   weightage  in our success criteria too. We will coour learning perfect when the Flight Model is accepted for launch.</p>

        <p align="justify" style="font-weight: bold">Q4. Why the addition of copyright rule to Pratham's documents?</p>
        <p align="justify">Ans: We have stressed in spreading our knowledge among the student community and giving students free access to our documents. But unfortunately it has backfired and some groups donot give us credit after having used our documents. Hence we will still give free access to the documents, only after a hardcopy of the copyright rule is sent to us by the student team.</p>

        <p align="justify" style="font-weight: bold">Q5. Why does Pratham not make all its Design documents opensource so that the student community can benefit from them?
        <p align="justify">Ans: The Pratham team believes that giving budding satellite teams access to PDR or CDR documents&nbsp;kills their desire to learn and takes away the learning from the design process itself. We have already seen it happen a couple of time and dont want this to happen again. We are more than willing to help student satellite teams and believe that even we can learn from their efforts.&nbsp;Hence, our request to all the student satellite teams is that they first prepare their own conceptual design documents, understand the intricacies of the satellite as a system and then approach us for the documents.&nbsp; </p>
